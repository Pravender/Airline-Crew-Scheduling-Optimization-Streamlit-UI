## Airline Crew Scheduling — Optimization + Streamlit UI

Project: End-to-end prototype for Airline Crew Scheduling using linear / integer optimization (set-partitioning) with a Streamlit visualization UI.
Author: Pravender Kumar (or your name) — use this repo as a ready-to-run demo, learning resource, or starting point for research/production.

## 🚀 Project Summary

This repository implements a practical prototype that:

Generates synthetic flight and crew data.
Builds feasible crew pairings (simple DFS-based generator with duty/rest/turn rules).
Solves the set-partitioning master (choose pairings to cover every flight exactly once) using Gurobi if available or PuLP/CBC fallback.
Computes KPIs (total cost, average duty hours, flights covered).
Provides an interactive Streamlit app to upload data, run the pipeline, visualize crew rosters (Gantt chart), and explore parameters.
This is a prototype intended for learning, extension to column generation / branch-and-price, and for building a polished UI for stakeholders.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Python 3.10 or later
Recommended: venv for environment isolation
Optional (for faster/advanced solving): Gurobi with a valid license and gurobipy installed

## 🛠️ Quick setup (Local)

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/airline-crew-scheduling.git
cd airline-crew-scheduling


Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv env
# macOS / Linux
source env/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
env\Scripts\Activate.ps1


Install Python dependencies:

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt


If you plan to use Gurobi, install gurobipy according to Gurobi's instructions and ensure your license is configured. If Gurobi is unavailable, the code falls back to PuLP + CBC.

(Add gurobipy here if you have Gurobi and want to include it in the environment.)

🧭 How to run (step-by-step)

You can run the entire pipeline through the Streamlit UI, or run components individually.

A — Run the full pipeline via Streamlit (recommended)
streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py


Open the URL printed by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501).

Use the sidebar to generate sample data, upload your own CSVs, tweak pairing parameters (max legs, max duty hours, min turn), and run the optimization.

View KPIs and interactive Gantt chart of chosen pairings.

B — Run components manually (CLI)

Generate sample data:

python src/data_generator.py
# Writes data/flights.csv and data/crews.csv to ./data/


Generate pairings:

python src/pairing_generator.py
# Writes data/pairings.json to ./data/


Solve set-partitioning master:

python src/master_solver.py
# Writes data/solution.json to ./data/


Evaluate KPIs:

python src/evaluator.py

🔎 Input / Output formats
data/flights.csv (generated by data_generator.py)

Columns:

flight_id — unique flight identifier (e.g., F0001)

origin — airport code (e.g., A0)

dest — destination airport code

dep_time — ISO datetime string

arr_time — ISO datetime string

aircraft — aircraft type (e.g., A320)

data/crews.csv

Columns:

crew_id — unique crew identifier

base — crew base airport

max_duty_hours — maximum duty hours (numeric)

hourly_cost — cost per duty hour

data/pairings.json and data/solution.json

pairings.json contains generated pairings with fields {pairing_id, flights, start, end, duty_hours, cost}.

solution.json contains chosen pairings and objective value.

🧠 Design choices / assumptions

Pairing generation: DFS-based extension with min-turn and max-duty pruning. This is intentionally simple for clarity and prototyping. Industrial systems use label-setting SPPRC with advanced dominance rules.

Master problem: set-partitioning solved on the pre-generated pool of pairings (no column generation in the prototype). This is simpler to implement and demonstrates the core pipeline.

Costs: duty_hours × hourly_cost + hotel_cost (if overnight). Extend to include deadheading, overtime penalties, reserve penalties.

Legal rules: simplified (max duty hours, min turn). For real deployments, replace with regulatory FTL (flight time limitations) and airline-specific rules.

📈 Streamlit UI features

Upload flights/crews CSV

Generate synthetic sample data

Tune pairing parameters: max legs, max duty hours, min turn time

Run the pipeline (pairing generation → master solve)

View metrics: total cost, average duty hours, pairings selected, flights covered

Interactive Gantt chart (Plotly timeline) showing pairings and flight blocks

🧪 Example experiments to run

Compare objective & KPIs as you vary max_duty_hours (6h → 12h).

Increase max_pairing_len and observe how solution cost changes.

Compare solver runtimes if you have Gurobi vs CBC (PuLP).

Add realistic costs (hotel, deadhead) and compare pairings chosen.

🔧 Extensions & next steps

This repository is a springboard for advanced features:

Replace DFS pairing generator with a label-setting SPPRC; implement proper dominance for speed.

Implement column generation + branch-and-price for exact integer solutions at scale.

Add multi-crew-type support (captain, FO, cabin crew) and crew composition constraints.

Create a rostering module: assign specific crew members to selected pairings while respecting time-off and fairness constraints.

Add unit tests, CI (GitHub Actions), and packaging for reuse.

Deploy Streamlit app publicly (Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or similar), and add a REST API for remote solving (FastAPI).
